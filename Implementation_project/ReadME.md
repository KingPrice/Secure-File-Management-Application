There are only 5 commands out of 6 which are still missing implementation
   connect: connects to server
disconnect: closes and shuts server down
    upload: uploads file to server then closes server

So far message.txt is just used to be transfered from client to server.

### TO DO ###
1. Add Delete command.
2. Add functionality to download so it list the files on the server.
3. Remove write once all other commands are properly implemented.
4. add OPENLDAP functionality. 
5. complete this list.
