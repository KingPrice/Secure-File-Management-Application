### Functionality ###
Verion 0.5.1 Alpha

So far only uses local connection on machine. 
IP: 127.0.0.1
Port: 7274 
 
There are only 5 commands out of 6 which are still missing implementation
   connect: connects to server
disconnect: closes and shuts server down
    upload: uploads file to server then closes server
  download: downloads file from server then closes 
     write: Prints out message on server //used for testing purposes should remove later

So far message.txt is just used to be transfered from client to server.
Other_file.txt was used to make sure that I did indeed transfer files.

### TO DO ###
1. add OPENLDAP functionality. 
2. Get to bind to the server.
3. complete this list.
